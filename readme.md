# A multi class text classifier using Logistic Regression.
## Utilizes with the Doc2Vec model for vectorization of text data
> 2 Doc2Vec Algorithmns used; Distributed Bag of Words and Distributed memory
> Concatennated both models for increased final accuracy in excess of 78%

#### The purpose of this project was to find a proof of concept for a binary classification model for a seperate project that is in development. As such the conclusions made here are not greatly meaningful as the task accomplished is meaningless. Although it is important to understand that this was by design. The data is standardized and well structured this is not the case in the aforementioned project.
